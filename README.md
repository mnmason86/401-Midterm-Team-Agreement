## Conflict Plan

#### Conflict Resolution Plan
- Check in with the team to make decisions, and vote if necessary. Involve TA/Instructor only if absolutely necessary!
- If one person starts to take over the project, we will conduct a team meeting to discuss relegation of tasks.
- To be sure everyone understands the challenges, we will explain our progress in daily stand-ups.
- If someone is not adequately contributing, we will conduct a team meeting to help with blockers and give support.

## Communication Plan

#### Hours for Communication

Normal class time 9am-6pm / Slack
- Darius: Slack only 2:30-4:30pm

Breaks as needed

To be sure everyone is heard, and we are creating a safe and comfortable working environment, we will be sure to keep our lines of communication open, and speak candidly but with respect.

## Work Plan

We will create a Trello board with our MVP tasks, and assign them judiciously, but check in daily to help relieve blockers and give support.
